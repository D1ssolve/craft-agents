description: "Concrete implementation patterns and techniques for .NET backend systems. Use when implementing any of: background worker task claiming that must survive pod kills or DB outages (lease/heartbeat pattern); race-free duplicate detection without pre-check queries; streaming large file exports without MemoryStream. Triggers on: lease pattern, LockToken, LockedUntil, heartbeat worker, background job, task queue DB, crash-safe processing, distributed lock, stale task recovery, unique constraint conflict, CommitResult, duplicate active record, HasActiveExport, streaming export, temp file upload, MemoryStream OOM, IAsyncEnumerable export, FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED.\n"

# Implementation Patterns

Navigation guide. Read the reference file for the specific pattern you need.

## Available Patterns

| Pattern | Reference File | Use When |
|---|---|---|
| **Lease-Based Background Processing** | [references/lease-based-processing.md](references/lease-based-processing.md) | Background worker claims DB tasks; must survive pod kills, DB outages, duplicate processing |
| **Race-Free Duplicate Detection** | [references/db-constraint-conflict-detection.md](references/db-constraint-conflict-detection.md) | Prevent duplicate active records (e.g. active exports per user); pre-check queries race |
| **Streaming File Export** | [references/streaming-file-export.md](references/streaming-file-export.md) | Export large datasets to file for S3/storage upload; avoid MemoryStream buffering |

## Quick Decision

- Worker claims tasks from a DB table, must handle crashes/kills → **lease-based-processing**
- "User already has an active X" constraint without a pre-check query → **db-constraint-conflict-detection**
- Export N rows to CSV/Excel and upload to S3, N is large or unbounded → **streaming-file-export**
